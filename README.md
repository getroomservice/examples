# Room Service

This repo contains examples of [Room Service](https://docs.roomservice.dev/) in different situations.

## Examples

### [next.js-minimal](https://github.com/getroomservice/examples/tree/master/next.js-minimal)

This example has a basic setup with Next.js and an [Auth Webhook](https://docs.roomservice.dev/docs/concepts/auth) setup already. Use it as a starting point to build the multiplayer app of your dreams.

Copy this into your terminal to use this example:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getroomservice/examples/master/create.sh | bash -s -- next.js-minimal
```

### [next.js-presence](https://github.com/getroomservice/examples/tree/master/next.js-presence)

This example has a basic setup with Next.js and shows off [Presence](https://docs.roomservice.dev/docs/concepts/presence), Room Service's real-time user metadata. Use it as a starting point to build things like live cursors.
