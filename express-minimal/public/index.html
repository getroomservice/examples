    <p>
      In this example, an Auth Webhook is setup in express, we've created a room
      and a list, but there's not much UI yet. You'll want to replace the
      API_KEY in
      <code>/src/server/index.js</code> before you get started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, open up <code>/src/client/client.js</code> to start building
      something great!
